**Open Renaissance Toolkit Design Proposal**<br/>
Towards a Software Architecture for Scientific Research Methods

## Abstract

Research software embody paradigms and methods of scientific research and mediate their - more or less - rigorous application. 

Reflecting on my deep-dive into scientific work I would like to bright up the spirits through outlining a futuristic systems architecture spanning 
different methods and phases of a scientific research process. In my example, the research process involved two trans-disciplinary literature reviews, 
multiple text and image analyses, categorization and clustering tasks, conceptual modeling, construct mapping, designing the research processes, but 
most of all, it involved reading. 

The interoperability of the existing dekstop tools supporting so called active reading of data stemming from a variety of sources is still quite wild.
Second hand data sources are especially diverse but also primary data, gathered through e.g. observation, interviewing, or analyzing various types of 
media seems still hard to get straight. Most recent scientific articles are stored directly next to screenshots capturing key messages from online conferences. 

Starting from this scenery, I want to share and discuss some design principles and an architecture draft, following which a future open research toolkit could 
be developed in coordination with a wide variety of open science software & data projects.

Utilizing a mixed set of research methods for creating the framework, I want to share 11 slides representing one software application, each representing 
a category of research software applications:

_Web Browsing, Document Editing, Document Viewing, Searching, Bibliography Management, Network and Concept Mapping, Timeline Filtering, Text Tokenization,
Data Capture, Archival, Data Processing_ and _Data Analysis_.

I would like to conclude with three slides outlining an architecture to systematize these functionalities along research methods, and integrate these 
along concurrent phases in research projects. These architecture drafts may help to systematically reflect on our common uses cases, research methods, 
design principles, digital standards and therewith would facilitate the continious and systematic integration of a wide range of open research 
software projects into highly individual personal processes of research.

## Objective

Facilitate the pooling of coding efforts on (often poorly funded) open research software tools.  At best, this is a conversation starter and facilitates 
the creation of interest and networks which would like to participate in the construction of an open source research software stack on a bauhaus scale.
